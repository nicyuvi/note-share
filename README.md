## Guideline:
### Naming conventions
- file names longer than one word should be spaced with a hyphen. i.e. `main-nav.tsx`
### Project Structure
- App router
- Components used only by a single page should be stored in the same directory
- Components used by multiple pages should be kept in the `/components` directory
- Components related to the layout should be kept in `/components/layout`
- UI components such as buttons should be kept in `/components/ui`
